# Sveltekit Pagetransitions

A simple implementation of page transitions for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

---

This is a copy of Evan Winter's implementation ([link](https://github.com/evanwinter/sveltekit-page-transitions)). I used this as a reference to learn how to do it myself.


The reason I published this repository, was because I wanted to see how deployment to vercel worked.
